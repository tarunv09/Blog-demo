This is my first post on my new fake blog! How exciting!

Though I'm not an avid writer but still I'll try to write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Oh, and here's a great quote on the Wikipedia from a movie called Terminator, 
[I'll be back](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27ll_be_back).

> "I'll be back" is a catchphrase associated with Arnold Schwarzenegger,
> which was made famous in the 1984 science fiction film The Terminator.
> On June 21, 2005, it was chosen as #37 on the American Film Institute list,  
> AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes. Schwarzenegger uses the same line,
> or some variant of it, in many of his later films.
