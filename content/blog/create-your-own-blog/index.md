Starting a blog looks difficult. You have to come up with a name, set it up somehow, figure out where to host it‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs enough to make you just give up and go write on Medium (or not at all).

If you manage to get started, there are yet more obstacles. How can you grow an audience if you‚Äôre starting from zero? How do you figure out what to write about? And then ‚Äì how do you keep writing, even when you don‚Äôt feel like it?

So that's why I have written this article. And Don't worry, I will walk you through everything you need to know. I will talk about:

    1. How to set up a blog in 10 minutes with GatsbyJS
    2. How to host it for free on Netlify

### üöÄ Quick start

Let's talk about [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). It‚Äôs a static site generator written in JavaScript and backed by React and GraphQL, and it‚Äôs gaining a ton of popularity lately.

I‚Äôm brand new to Gatsby myself, and I thought I‚Äôd want share this guide as this blog was itself created using gatsby.

Gatsby allows you to write in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), a simple plain text format that‚Äôs easy to learn and easy to write with. Gatsby then takes the Markdown files and generates the HTML blog posts. Also this doesn't mean that Gatsby is only for blogs but you can create a lot more like a e-commerce website ‚Äì but since we‚Äôre talking about blogs here, I‚Äôll keep things focused on the blogging use case.

Let‚Äôs walk through setting up your blog right now. You‚Äôll need to make sure Node and NPM installed. If not, check how to install [Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/) first.

  1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

      First, install the Gatsby CLI. This will give you the 'gatsby' command:

      ```shell
        npm install -g gatsby-cli
      ```
      Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the blog starter.

      Now, create a new Gatsby site using the blog starter
      ```shell
          gatsby new <my-new-blog-directory> https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog
      ``` 

  2.  **Start developing.**

      Navigate into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up.

      ```shell
          cd <my-new-blog-directory>
          gatsby develop
      ```

  3.  **Open the source code and Make It YOUR OWN!**

      Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!
      Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you  can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).

      Open the `my-new-blog directory` in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

      Open up the `gatsby-config.js` file in the root directory, and customize the `siteMetadata` stuff at the top. **Kyle Mathews is great but this is YOUR blog**, now.

      Scroll down a little further and read through the list of plugins, if you like. Or just ignore them for now.

      Update the image at `content/assets/profile-pic.jpg` to be **your own face** instead of Kyle‚Äôs.

  4.  **Write a New Post**

      This starter project is set up to look for blog posts under the `content/blog` directory (because `gatsby-config.js` told it to).

      To create a new post, you just need to create a new file in there, with a `.md` or `.markdown` extension. To try it out, create a file called `first-post.md` under `content/blog`. Inside this file, write this out:

      ```shell
            ---
            title: My First Post
            ---

            Hello World, Welcome my new blog!
            The stuff at the top inside the dashes is called ‚Äúfrontmatter‚Äù. Here you can set the title, date, and other metadata about the post. The frontmatter won‚Äôt appear in the final document.
      ```

      As soon as you save this, the Gatsby development server will pick it up and re-generate the blog. If you have http://localhost:8000/ open already, it‚Äôll hot-reload with your new post on the front page.

      Click on your new post. Oooh, it loads so fast! Ok, fine, it‚Äôs on localhost, and it has basically zero content, but still. It‚Äôs snappy. Gatsby makes fast sites.

      If you look at the URL bar, you‚Äôll notice that Gatsby has used the filename as the URL, without the .md extension.

      Gatsby will also find files in subdirectories of content/blog, so you could create a new folder for each post if you want to. Look at the existing posts, and you‚Äôll see that they exist as index.md files within directories. Further, notice how their URL is determined by the directory name.

      ```shell
          Try This: What happens if you create a similar file under the content/blog/hello-world directory?
           Does it appear on the front page? 
           What‚Äôs the resulting URL? 
           Does it all make sense? If not, edit as much as want!
      ```

  5. **Now It's Time to Push Your Blog to GitHub**

      Go to GitHub and create a new repo. **Don‚Äôt check ‚Äúinitialize the repo with a README‚Äù** because we‚Äôre going to import the everything pre-made from your machine.

      In your blog directory, initialize the Git repo, add the files, and commit them:

        git init
        git add .
        git commit -m "message"
        
      Then push the repo to GitHub:

        git remote add origin https://github.com/yourname/repo-name.git
        git push -u origin master
    
      If you refresh your blog‚Äôs GitHub repo now, you should see the README file that says **‚ÄúGatsby‚Äôs blog starter‚Äù**. With your blog up on GitHub, you can now deploy it to Netlify.

  6. **Finally, Deploy Your Gatsby Blog to Web using Netlify**

      
      Netlify is a great free hosting service for static sites. My own blog, the one you‚Äôre reading now, runs on Netlify. It‚Äôs easy to set up, and publishing new posts is as easy as git push.

      Create a new account at [Netlify](http://app.netlify.com/). Netlify can pull from GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab.

      Then sign in and click **‚ÄúNew Site from Git‚Äù**.

      Then choose Github, and authorize Netlify to access your Github account.

      Next you‚Äôll **‚Äúinstall‚Äù** Netlify to your Github account. and set permissions according to your preference like limit its access to just the blog repo.

      Now you can choose the repository to deploy ‚Äì pick the blog repo you created.

      On the next screen, click **‚ÄúDeploy Site‚Äù**. After a minute or so of building, your site will be published and ready to view!

      It‚Äôll have some sort of ugly URL by default, but Netlify makes it easy to point a custom domain at it if you have one. Netlify will set up free SSL for you, too. If you need a domain, you can try something like NameCheap (because I've been using them for free, thanks to **[Github Student Developer Pack]**(https://education.github.com/pack).
